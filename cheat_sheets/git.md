## Git Config (For Aliases)

```txt
a = add .
acm = !git add . && git commit -m
rt = restore .
f = fetch
co = checkout
cd = checkout develop
cb = checkout -b
fco = !git fetch && git checkout
br = branch
ci = commit
cm = commit -m
ca = commit --amend
cp = cherry-pick
st = status
sa = stash apply
lone = log --oneline
last = log -1 HEAD
reset = reset --hard HEAD~1
unstage = reset --soft HEAD^
current = rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD
plo = pull origin
pld = pull origin develop
plm = pull origin main
plc = !CURRENT=$(git current) && git pull origin $CURRENT
psc = !CURRENT=$(git current) && git push origin $CURRENT
pso = push origin
dev = !git checkout develop && git pull origin develop
main = !git checkout main && git pull origin main
brd = !sh -c 'git branch -l $1/* | xargs git branch -D' -
brdall = !sh -c 'git branch -l | xargs git branch -D' -
```

### Aliasing `git` in `.bashrc`

```sh
# Main git completions (prior to git 2.30, you an use _git instead of __git_main)
alias g="git"
__git_complete g __git_main
```

## Clone local repository

```sh
:home$ git clone git_origin this_cloned
Cloning into 'this_cloned' ...
done.

:home$ cd this_cloned
:home/this_clone$ git remote -v
origin  /home/git_origin (fetch)
origin  /home/git_origin (push)
```

To add other repository as a remote:

```sh
git remote add <remote_name> <other_repo>
```

## Get current branch

```sh
git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD
```

## Get oldest commit

```sh
git rev-list --max-parents=0 HEAD
```

Rebasing using the oldest commit:

```sh
git rebase -i $(git rev-list --max-parents=0 HEAD) HEAD
```

## Get all local branches with prefix

```sh
git branch -l <prefix>/*

# Can delete found branches
git branch -l <prefix>/* | xargs git branch -D
```

## Get history of the repository

```sh
git log

# gives useful information about refs names
git log --decorate <--online>

# only short hash and commit message
git log --oneline

# with visual representation
git log --online --graph

# show all branches
git log --online --graph --all --decorate
```

## Check local changes

```sh
git diff
```

## Check URL of the cloned repository

```sh
grep -A 'remote "origin"' .git/config
```

## Recover repository state

```sh
# restore state
git reset

# default flag (staged to unstaged)
# keeps items altered in current working tree
git reset --mixed

# reset working tree to last commit
# lose changes of the items
git reset --hard
```

## Branch out from specific commit

```sh
# checkout commit to detached head
git checkout <commit hash>

# from detached head to new branch
git checkout -b <new branch_name>
```

## Stashing changes

```sh
# commit the local change to refs/stash branch
# and merge as a chield of HEAD on new refs/stash branch
git stash

# retrieve list
git stash list

# reapply changes on the same codebase
git stash pop

# get individual stash information
git stash show --patch <ID>
#git stash show --patch stash@{1}

# applying a specific stash
git stash apply <ID>
#git stash apply stash@{1}

# remove specific stash
git stash drop <ID>
#git stash drop stash@{1}
```

## Applying remote changes to local using fetch and merge

```sh
# get changes on thre remote "master" branch
git fetch origin master

# applying remote changes to local
git merge origin/master
```

You can see this repository's view of all branches by:

```sh
$ git branch --all
* master
  remotes/origin/HEAD -> origin/master
  remotes/origin/master
```

## Check tracking remote branch of local branch

```sh
$ git branch -vv
* main                          fcc92c7 [origin/main] Fix badge
  summary/Add                   6d9cefd [origin/summary/Add] Add badge
  summary/dockerfile            aa2080d Done dockerfile
  summary/internet              028b27e Fix lint
```

Note that `summary/internet` branch is not tracking any remote branch. So when pushing using `git push`, error will be encountered:

```sh
git push

fatal: The current branch summary/internet has no upstream branch.
To push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use

    git push --set-upstream origin summary/internet
```

Solution for above error is:

```sh
# set upstream or remote branch for the local branch
git push --set-upstream origin summary/internet

# or
git push -u origin summary/internet
```

## Difference of `~`(tilde) and `^`(caret)

The `~`(tilde) and `^`(caret) symbols are used to point to a position relative to a specific commit. The symbols are used together with a commit reference, typically HEAD or a commit hash.

- `~`n refers to the nth grandparent. `HEAD~1` refers to the commit's first parent. `HEAD~2` refers to the first parent of the commit's first parent.

- `^`n refers to the the nth parent. `HEAD^1` refers to the commit's first parent. `HEAD^2` refers to the commit's second parent. A commit can have two parents in a merge commit.

git add -i

(1/1) Stage this hunk [y,n,q,a,d,/,s,e,?]?
```

Meaning of each options:

```txt
y - stage this hunk
n - do not stage this hunk
q - quit; do not stage this hunk or any of the remaining ones
a - stage this hunk and all later hunks in the file
d - do not stage this hunk or any of the later hunks in the file
g - select a hunk to go to
/ - search for a hunk matching the given regex
j - leave this hunk undecided, see next undecided hunk
J - leave this hunk undecided, see next hunk
e - manually edit the current hunk
? - print help
```

**Splitting hunks** are useful to avoid committing lines you might want to keep for local development but not persist in the repository history. A typical example of this is printed debug lines that you donâ€™t want to get to production but want to keep for local development. Another example might be chunks of notes that only make sense to you while you are developing.

## Notes

- A `branch` is a pointer to the end of a line of changes.
- A `tag` is a pointer to a single change.
- `HEAD` is where your Git repository is right now.
- `Detached HEAD` means you are at a commit that has no reference (branch or tag) associated with it.
- `git stash apply` remains in the list but `git stash pop` will remove the stash item
- A `hunk` is a contiguous section of a `diff`.
- `reflog` is short for **ref**erence **log**. It _records all movements_ of branches in the repository.
- After rebasing using `git rebase`, you always end up in a `detached HEAD` state.
